Cargo Tracker Readme

Tracks two cargoes in the goals; for each company and an overall total.

The two cargoes to track can be set in the settings using the appropriate cargo ID number.

The script goes through each industry that accepts those cargoes, and queries how much each company has delivered to each one, totaling it up at the start of each month.
Therefore, performance might drop if the cargo chosen has a lot of industries that accept that cargo.
